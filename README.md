## PyBank


* In this project, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. The data set is in a csv format composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

* I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

  ```

* The final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
